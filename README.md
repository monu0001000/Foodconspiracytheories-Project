Project Title
"Food Conspiracy Central"
(A platform for creating and voting on the most outrageous food conspiracy theories.)

Project Overview:

Food Conspiracy Central is a web application where users can create, share, and vote on the most outlandish and humorous conspiracy theories about food. The goal is to create a fun, interactive community-driven platform where users can showcase their creativity and humor while engaging with others. Users can submit their own theories, upvote/downvote others, and see which theories are the most popular or outrageous.

Key Features User Authentication:

Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.

Authentication ensures only logged-in users can submit or vote on theories.

Create Conspiracy Theories:

Users can submit their own food conspiracy theories with a title and description.

Example: "The government puts pineapple on pizza to distract us from the real issue: ice cream cones are secretly the best food."

Voting System:

Users can upvote or downvote theories to determine which ones are the most outrageous or popular.

Display theories sorted by the number of votes (most outrageous at the top).

Theory Feed:

Display a feed of all submitted theories, sorted by popularity or recency.

Each theory card shows the title, description, author, and vote count.

Search and Filter:

Users can search for specific theories or filter them by tags (e.g., "pineapple," "ice cream," "government").

User Profiles:

Users can view their profile to see the theories they’ve submitted and their voting history.

Admin Panel (Optional):

Admins can moderate theories, remove inappropriate content, and manage users.
